- Web-hosting
- WebSocket support


## üë®‚Äçüíª Who uses `laf`?

1. Front-end developers + `laf` = Full-stack developers, transforming front-end developers into true full-stack developers.

   - `laf` provides [laf-client-sdk](https://github.com/labring/laf/tree/main/packages/client-sdk) for front-end developers, suitable for any JavaScript runtime environment.
   - `laf` allows front-end and back-end code to be developed using JavaScript/TypeScript, eliminating the barrier between them and enabling a quick learning curve.
   - `laf` offers static website hosting, allowing direct deployment of front-end built web pages without the need for server configuration, nginx, domains, etc.
   - `laf` will provide SDKs for various client platforms (Flutter/Android/iOS, etc.) in the future, offering backend development services and a consistent development experience for all client developers.

2. Back-end developers can free themselves from trivial tasks and focus on the core business, enhancing development efficiency.

   - `laf` saves effort on server maintenance, multi-environment deployment, and management.
   - `laf` eliminates the need for configuration and debugging of nginx.
   - `laf` eliminates the repetitive work of manually deploying databases and addressing security concerns for each project.
   - `laf` eliminates the tedious iterative experience of "making changes and taking half a day to publish."
   - `laf` allows you to view function execution logs anytime, anywhere on the web without the need to connect to servers or spend time searching.
   - `laf` enables you to "write a function like writing a blog," making it easy to publish and invoke functions effortlessly.

3. Cloud development users, if you are a user of other cloud development platforms, `laf` not only provides a more powerful and fast development experience but also prevents vendor lock-in.

   - You can deliver source code to clients and privately deploy a `laf` + your cloud development application. Closed-source cloud development services cannot deliver independently runnable source code.
   - You can deploy your own product to your servers at any time according to future needs, as `laf` is open-source and free.
   - You can even modify and customize your own cloud development platform, as `laf` is open-source and highly extensible.

4. Independent developers and startup teams can save costs, start quickly, and focus on their business.

   - Reduce the project development process, start quickly, and shorten the product validation cycle.
   - Greatly improve iteration speed, adapt to changes at any time, and release updates quickly.
   - Focus on the core business of the product, quickly launch Minimum Viable Products (MVP), and validate the product and market rapidly.
   - One person + `laf` = a team.
