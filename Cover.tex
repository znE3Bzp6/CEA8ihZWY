I am writing to apply for the \Position\hspace{3pt}position advertised on \Posted. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Vanderbilt University, and I expect to receive my degree in May 2020. I am broadly interested in policy relevant topics in applied microeconomics. My primary research interests are at the intersection of labor economics and the economics of education with secondary interests in health and urban economics. 

In my job market paper, \emph{Personal Finance Education Mandates and Student Loan Repayment}, I investigate whether state mandated personal finance education during high school improves federal student loan repayment after college. I find that these mandates improve repayment and that the effect is largest for low-income and first generation students at public universities. This paper received the award of \emph{Best Graduate Student Paper} at the Missouri Valley Economic Association Annual Meeting, was instrumental in my receipt of a dissertation grant from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, and has been featured in the \emph{Policy Genius} magazine. 

% Here, we begin custom sections. Each if/then will allow for a custom section depending on the type of job.

% The first custom job is for academic economics position (econ_academic)

\ifthenelse{\equal{\CoverLetterCat}{econ_academic}}{%
In addition to my research in education and labor economics, I also study topics in urban and health economics. In my co-authored paper, \emph{The Marginal Congestion of a Taxi in New York City}, we study how the introduction of a new geographically restricted taxi fleet in New York City affected localized congestion. This paper was presented at the 2018 NBER Summer Institute and is currently being revised for resubmission at the \emph{American Economic Review}. I also have a working paper that estimates the impact of a weekend supplemental nutrition intervention in the Mississippi Delta region on childhood test scores and attendance. \CoverBonusResearch  

During my graduate career at Vanderbilt University and the University of Memphis, I have served as a teaching assistant, tutor, and supplemental instructor. These experiences have prepared me to teach courses on a range of topics in economics, policy evaluation, causal inference, and applied econometrics. My commitment to teaching has resulted in a portfolio of outstanding evaluations from students and professors alike, and I was recently awarded the \emph{Rendigs Fels Award for Excellence in Teaching}.%

I have several current works in progress in the fields of labor, education, health, and urban economics. In these papers, I study how college students react to federal financial aid austerity, how merit aid scholarships affect college and labor market outcomes for low-income students, and how the rise of e-commerce delivery has contributed to increased congestion in the United States.

During my graduate career at Vanderbilt University and the University of Memphis, I have served as a teaching assistant, tutor, and supplemental instructor. These experiences have prepared me to teach in both introductory and advanced economics courses. I have course preparations for Introduction to Microeconomics, Intermediate Microeconomics, Labor Economics, Economics of Risk, Sports Economics, and Applied Econometrics. I can also prepare courses in Urban Economics, Public Economics, and the Economics of Social Issues.

During my graduate career at Vanderbilt University and the University of Memphis, I have gained a wealth of technical skills and research experience. Of these skills, I am particularly experienced in data analysis, program evaluation, applied econometrics, and data visualization. I am proficient in Stata, Python, R, and Matlab and I am competent in QGIS/ArcGIS and SQL. I am also particularly effective at communicating technical and complex data products and analysis in both written and oral settings.
